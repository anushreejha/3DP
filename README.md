# <p align="center"> Securing 3DP in an Era of Advancing Quantum Computing </p>

# Introduction
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the intersection of 3D printing (3DP) and quantum computing presents both opportunities and challenges. As quantum computing continues to advance, traditional cryptographic methods may become vulnerable to attacks, posing risks to the security and integrity of 3D printing processes and data.

This project aims to address these challenges by implementing robust security measures to protect 3D printing workflows from potential threats posed by advancing quantum computing capabilities. By leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic techniques such as Dilithium signature schemes and SHA hashing algorithms, the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of 3D printing data and communications is ensured.

# Features
- **Dilithium Signature Schemes:** Utilizing Dilithium signature schemes for secure digital signatures, ensuring non-repudiation and authenticity of 3D printing files and communications.

- **SHA Hashing:** Employing SHA hashing algorithms to compute cryptographic hash functions, providing data integrity and protection against tampering.

- **Blockchain Integration:** Exploring the integration of blockchain technology to enhance transparency, traceability, and immutability of 3D printing processes and transactions.

- **User Authentication:** Implementing robust user authentication mechanisms to control access to 3D printing resources and prevent unauthorized activities.
